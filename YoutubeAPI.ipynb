It's not too dissimiliar to what would be used on the IMDB dataset examples seen in class. Which makes sense as both are binary text classification with rudimentary sentiment analysis problems. Most if not all of our variables changed, and I did try with different added in layers, but they never came out with as good of end-results as the IMDB model. The LSTM model probably would be better in the long run, but it barely trains in colab due to minimal free resources. But the rudimentary version below will run, it just takes way too long to train, considering how well the other does in a fraction of the time.\n",

        "And as I am cleaning up the file... I realized that when I set this part here up after the original code, I programmed it in a functional programming style not object-oriented. And I'm not sure why, as all of my prior experience is in OOP (outside of Javascripts fake functional oop) Maybe I've been doing too much javascript lately, maybe colab feels more functional style to Me... idk. But it's an interesting thought for me to ponder."
